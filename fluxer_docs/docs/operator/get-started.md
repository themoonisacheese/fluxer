# Get Started

Run your own Fluxer instance with Docker Compose. This guide takes you from a fresh server to a working self-hosted instance with the web app, API, gateway, admin dashboard, media uploads, search, storage, and voice signaling behind one public hostname.

!!! info "Desktop client support is coming very soon"
    The desktop client cannot connect to self-hosted instances yet, so reach your instance through the web app in the meantime. Support is actively being worked on and lands very soon. You can track the progress in [issue #1088](https://github.com/fluxerapp/fluxer/issues/1088#issuecomment-4951728735).

## Requirements

- A Linux server or VM that can run Docker Engine.
- Docker Engine plus the Docker Compose plugin.
- A hostname for the instance, for example `chat.example.com`.
- Either public inbound `80/tcp` and `443/tcp`, or a Cloudflare Tunnel that routes the hostname to the Caddy container.
- For production voice and video media, a public path to `7881/tcp` and `7882/udp`.
- At least 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, and 20 GB disk. Use 4 vCPU and 8 GB RAM or more for a small active community.

The stack idles around a few GB of memory, and startup is the heaviest point because all service images initialize at once.

## Step 1: Install Docker

Install Docker Engine from Docker's official instructions for your distribution:

- [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Install the Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)
- [Linux post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

Confirm the versions:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

Use Docker Engine 24 or newer and the Compose v2 plugin.

## Step 2: Download the stack

Create a working directory and download the stack files:

```bash
mkdir fluxer
cd fluxer

base=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluxerapp/fluxer/main/deploy/self-hosting
curl -fsSLO "$base/docker-compose.yml"
curl -fsSLO "$base/Caddyfile"
curl -fsSLO "$base/livekit.yaml"
curl -fsSL "$base/.env.example" -o .env
```

You should now have:

```text
Caddyfile
docker-compose.yml
livekit.yaml
.env
```

## Step 3: Configure `.env`

Set the public hostname at the top of `.env`.

For a normal public server where Caddy obtains certificates directly:

```ini
FLUXER_DOMAIN=chat.example.com
FLUXER_PUBLIC_SCHEME=https
FLUXER_PUBLIC_PORT=443
FLUXER_CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS=chat.example.com
FLUXER_VAPID_EMAIL=admin@example.com
```

For a Cloudflare Tunnel where Cloudflare terminates HTTPS and forwards HTTP to Caddy:

```ini
FLUXER_DOMAIN=chat.example.com
FLUXER_PUBLIC_SCHEME=https
FLUXER_PUBLIC_PORT=443
FLUXER_CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS=:80
FLUXER_VAPID_EMAIL=admin@example.com
```

`FLUXER_PUBLIC_SCHEME` and `FLUXER_PUBLIC_PORT` describe what users see in their browser. `FLUXER_CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS` describes what Caddy listens on inside the stack.

Generate the required secrets:

```bash
for key in POSTGRES_PASSWORD MEILI_MASTER_KEY FLUXER_S3_SECRET_KEY \
  FLUXER_SUDO_MODE_SECRET FLUXER_CONNECTION_INITIATION_SECRET \
  FLUXER_GATEWAY_RPC_AUTH_TOKEN FLUXER_MEDIA_PROXY_SECRET_KEY \
  FLUXER_ADMIN_SECRET_KEY_BASE FLUXER_ADMIN_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET \
  LIVEKIT_API_SECRET; do
  sed -i "s|^$key=.*|$key=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|" .env
done

sed -i "s|^FLUXER_MEDIA_PROXY_UPLOAD_RELAY_SECRET_BASE64=.*|FLUXER_MEDIA_PROXY_UPLOAD_RELAY_SECRET_BASE64=$(openssl rand -base64 32)|" .env

VAPID=$(docker run --rm node:24-alpine npx --yes web-push generate-vapid-keys --json)
pub=$(printf '%s' "$VAPID" | grep -o '"publicKey":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
priv=$(printf '%s' "$VAPID" | grep -o '"privateKey":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
sed -i "s|^FLUXER_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=.*|FLUXER_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=$pub|" .env
sed -i "s|^FLUXER_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=.*|FLUXER_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=$priv|" .env
```

Keep these defaults unless you know you need to change them:

- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY=fluxer`; the secret is `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`.
- `FLUXER_S3_ACCESS_KEY=fluxer`; the secret is `FLUXER_S3_SECRET_KEY`.
- Email starts disabled. Enable SMTP later from `.env` and the admin dashboard.
- Passkeys follow `FLUXER_DOMAIN`. Override `FLUXER_PASSKEY_RP_ID`, `FLUXER_PASSKEY_RP_NAME`, and `FLUXER_PASSKEY_ADDITIONAL_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` only when browsers reach the instance on a different host.

!!! warning "Changing the passkey relying party invalidates passkeys"
    Browsers bind each passkey to the `FLUXER_PASSKEY_RP_ID` it was registered under. Changing that value later leaves every existing passkey unusable, so members have to enrol again.

!!! warning "Keep `.env` private"
    `.env` contains every secret for the instance. Do not commit it, paste it into support tickets, or put it in screenshots.

## Step 4: Publish the hostname

=== "Direct public server"

    Create DNS records for the hostname:

    - `A` record from `chat.example.com` to the server IPv4 address.
    - Optional `AAAA` record from `chat.example.com` to the server IPv6 address.

    Leave `FLUXER_CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS=chat.example.com`. Caddy will request and renew certificates automatically when `80/tcp` and `443/tcp` can reach the server.

=== "Cloudflare Tunnel"

    Use this when the server should not expose public web ports.

    1. Set `FLUXER_CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS=:80`.
    2. In Cloudflare, create a Tunnel public hostname for your Fluxer domain.
    3. If `cloudflared` runs inside the Compose project, point the public hostname service to `http://caddy:80`.
    4. If `cloudflared` runs directly on the host, point the public hostname service to `http://127.0.0.1:80`.

    A temporary Compose override keeps the tunnel next to Caddy without saving the token in your main stack:

    ```bash
    cat > cloudflared.compose.yml <<'YAML'
    services:
      cloudflared:
        image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
        restart: unless-stopped
        command: tunnel run --token ${CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN:?set CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN}
        depends_on:
          - caddy
        networks:
          - fluxer
    YAML

    export CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN='paste-your-tunnel-token-here'
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f cloudflared.compose.yml up -d cloudflared
    ```

    !!! warning "Voice media is not carried by a normal public hostname tunnel"
        The web app, API, admin dashboard, gateway WebSocket, media proxy HTTP routes, and LiveKit signaling can work through the tunnel. LiveKit WebRTC media still needs reachable `7881/tcp` and `7882/udp`, or a TURN deployment.

## Step 5: Open the firewall

If you are using a direct public server, allow inbound:

- `22/tcp` or your SSH port.
- `80/tcp` and `443/tcp` for Caddy.
- `7881/tcp` and `7882/udp` for LiveKit media.

If you are using a Cloudflare Tunnel for web traffic, you can block inbound `80/tcp` and `443/tcp` at the provider firewall. Keep LiveKit media closed too unless you are intentionally exposing voice/video media or using a TURN server.

!!! warning "Provider firewall first"
    Docker-published ports can bypass host firewalls such as UFW because Docker installs its own packet-filtering rules. Prefer your cloud provider's firewall or security group for internet-facing policy.

## Step 6: Start the stack

Start Fluxer:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If you are using the Cloudflare override from above, start both files together:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f cloudflared.compose.yml up -d
```

Watch the startup:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f api
```

The first start can take several minutes while images download and services initialize. `seaweedfs-init` exits after creating object-storage buckets; that is expected.

## Step 7: Create the owner account

Open the web app:

```text
https://chat.example.com
```

Register the first account. On a self-hosted instance, the first accepted registration receives wildcard admin access. Use that account for the initial admin login:

```text
https://chat.example.com/admin
```

Complete the initial setup from the admin dashboard. At minimum, review:

- Branding and instance name.
- Registration mode: open, approval, or closed.
- Email delivery.
- Captcha policy if you open public registration.
- Single-community mode if you want one default community instead of many user-created communities.
- Voice regions and LiveKit reachability if you are enabling voice.

## Email

Email is disabled by default. To enable SMTP, set these in `.env` and restart `api`, `worker`, and `admin`:

```ini
FLUXER_EMAIL_ENABLED=true
FLUXER_EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp
FLUXER_EMAIL_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@example.com
FLUXER_EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Fluxer
FLUXER_EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
FLUXER_EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
FLUXER_EMAIL_SMTP_USERNAME=example
FLUXER_EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD=example-secret
FLUXER_EMAIL_SMTP_SECURE=true
```

Then test the SMTP configuration from `/admin/instance-config`.

## Voice and video

Fluxer uses LiveKit for voice and video. Caddy routes `/livekit` to LiveKit's HTTP/WebSocket signaling port, but browser media flows over WebRTC:

- `7882/udp` is the normal media path.
- `7881/tcp` is the TCP fallback path.
- `7880/tcp` stays private behind Caddy for signaling.

On a VPS with `7881/tcp` and `7882/udp` open, LiveKit can usually auto-detect the public IP. Behind NAT, Cloudflare Tunnel, or restrictive networks, add a TURN server and configure LiveKit for it.

## Backups

Back up these items before upgrades and on a regular schedule:

- `.env`
- `postgres-data`
- `seaweedfs-data`

For a cold backup:

```bash
docker compose stop api worker gateway admin app-proxy media-proxy static-proxy livekit
docker run --rm -v fluxer_postgres-data:/data -v "$PWD/backups:/backup" alpine tar czf /backup/postgres-data.tgz -C /data .
docker run --rm -v fluxer_seaweedfs-data:/data -v "$PWD/backups:/backup" alpine tar czf /backup/seaweedfs-data.tgz -C /data .
docker compose up -d
```

For production, prefer a Postgres-native dump plus object-storage backup so you do not need to stop the instance.

## Upgrading

The default image tag is `v1`, which tracks the latest compatible release:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The `fluxer-static` image is part of the default stack, so static asset updates are picked up by the same pull-and-restart flow.

To pin a specific release, set `FLUXER_IMAGE_TAG` in `.env` to the release tag you want, then pull and restart.

Each upgrade leaves the previous images behind, which adds up to a few gigabytes over time. To reclaim that space:

```bash
docker image prune -f
```

This removes only the untagged images the upgrade replaced. `docker system prune -a` reclaims more, but it also deletes every image not currently used by a running container, including ones unrelated to Fluxer.
